                                Refunds typically undergo a thorough review process, which can vary based on several factors including payment method, bank processing times, and any specific policies related to your booking.

                                This means you can expect to see your refund within 10-15 business days. We're committed to transparency and will keep you informed every step of the way.

                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused. 
                                Thanks for bearing with us while we get this sorted. We genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. 
                                Refund timelines can vary, but we're here to ensure a smooth process! On average, it takes them 5 business days to process these, and once we receive those funds, our internal processing takes about 6 days. 
                                This means you can expect to see your refund within 10-15 business days. We're committed to transparency and will keep you informed every step of the way.

                                As your travel agency, we're here to make your booking experience as smooth as possible and assist with your travel needs. 
                                While we can help with most inquiries, like itinerary changes and general questions, there are some cases where you'll need to contact the airline directly. 
                                This is due to airline policies that require their intervention. Rest assured, we’ll continue to support you in any way we can to ensure your trip goes smoothly.

                                We totally understand how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. 
                                But sometimes, delays beyond our control can happen. Please kindly note, any extra delay might not be our fault—sometimes it's down to how quickly your bank processes the refund once we've sent it over. Thanks for bearing with us while we get this sorted. 
                                We genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. If you've got any other questions or need a hand with anything else, just let us know. We're here to help!

                                3. The doctor's certificate must state the examination date, examination results, diagnosis and the fact that you are unable to travel.<br>
                                4. The doctor must use the Gotogate doctor's certificate (I will send the link via email): this is the only doctor's certificate we accept. 
                                The doctor's certificate must be printed by an independent party for the doctor's certificate to be valid.<br><br>

                                We totally get how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, 
                                and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. 
                                Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. 
                                But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused.
